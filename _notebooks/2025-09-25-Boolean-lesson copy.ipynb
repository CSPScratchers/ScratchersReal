    "# Lesson: Introduction to Boolean Logic in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean logic is the backbone of all programming decisions. It allows programs to make choices and perform actions based on conditions that evaluate to either **True** or **False**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean logic in Python is based on **truth values** ‚Äî `True` and `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `True` means the statement or condition is correct.  \n",
    "- `False` means it is incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Boolean** is its own data type in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = True\n",
    "y = False\n",
    "\n",
    "print(type(x))  # <class 'bool'>\n",
    "print(type(y))  # <class 'bool'>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Booleans are often used with if statements, loops, and logical operations to control how a program behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Relational Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational operators compare two values and return a Boolean (True or False).\n",
    "They are fundamental to decision-making in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator\tMeaning\tExample\tOutput\n",
    "==\tEqual to\t5 == 5\tTrue\n",
    "!=\tNot equal to\t5 != 3\tTrue\n",
    ">\tGreater than\t10 > 2\tTrue\n",
    "<\tLess than\t2 < 5\tTrue\n",
    ">=\tGreater than or equal to\t5 >= 5\tTrue\n",
    "<=\tLess than or equal to\t3 <= 4\tTrue\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Examples Using Relational Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "print(a == b)   # False, because 10 is not equal to 20\n",
    "print(a < b)    # True, because 10 is less than 20\n",
    "print(a != b)   # True, because 10 and 20 are not equal\n",
    "print(a >= 10)  # True, because 10 is equal to 10\n",
    "print(b <= 15)  # False, because 20 is not less than or equal to 15\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational operators are commonly used in conditions, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "temperature = 32\n",
    "\n",
    "if temperature < 40:\n",
    "    print(\"It‚Äôs a cold day.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"It‚Äôs a warm day.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. The NOT Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The not operator reverses a Boolean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expression\tResult\n",
    "not True\tFalse\n",
    "not False\tTrue\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "is_raining = True\n",
    "print(not is_raining)  # False\n",
    "\n",
    "logged_in = False\n",
    "print(not logged_in)   # True\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage in conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "logged_in = False\n",
    "\n",
    "if not logged_in:\n",
    "    print(\"Please log in first.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Welcome back!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. The AND Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The and operator returns True only if both conditions are True.\n",
    "\n",
    "A\tB\tA and B\n",
    "True\tTrue\tTrue\n",
    "True\tFalse\tFalse\n",
    "False\tTrue\tFalse\n",
    "False\tFalse\tFalse\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "age = 18\n",
    "has_license = True\n",
    "\n",
    "if age >= 16 and has_license:\n",
    "    print(\"You can drive!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You cannot drive.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "print(True and True)   # True\n",
    "print(True and False)  # False\n",
    "print(False and True)  # False\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. The OR Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The or operator returns True if at least one condition is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "A\tB\tA or B\n",
    "True\tTrue\tTrue\n",
    "True\tFalse\tTrue\n",
    "False\tTrue\tTrue\n",
    "False\tFalse\tFalse\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "is_weekend = False\n",
    "is_holiday = True\n",
    "\n",
    "if is_weekend or is_holiday:\n",
    "    print(\"You can relax today!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You have school.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(True or False)   # True\n",
    "print(False or False)  # False\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Booleans (True / False) represent truth values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) compare values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators (not, and, or) combine or modify Boolean results.\n",
    "\n",
    "not flips a value, and needs both conditions true, or needs at least one true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Idea:\n",
    "Boolean logic allows your Python programs to make smart decisions ‚Äî like whether to log in a user, open a file, or trigger an event. It‚Äôs the foundation for all control flow in programming.\n",
